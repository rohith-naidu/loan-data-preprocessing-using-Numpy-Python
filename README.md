# This is a Numpy-Python Project of Loan Data
We obtained a loandata dataset that had many gaps, errors, and inconsistencies. 
Filled in the missing values with reasonable estimates. 
Converted the textual data into numerical values by assigning a code for each category. 
Imputed the worst-case values for the strings that had no data.

Finally obtained preprocessed loan data for futher analysis.
